            Miles Gonzalo Morales[1][2] (/məˈrælɛs/) is a fictional character, a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is one of the characters known as Spider-Man, having been created in 2011 by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, with input by Marvel's then-editor-in-chief Axel Alonso. The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider-Man, which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis Norman Osborn in an attempt to duplicate those abilities.
            The biracial teenage son of an African-American father and a Puerto Rican mother, Miles Morales is the second Spider-Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe called the Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610), first appearing in Ultimate Fallout #4 (August 2011), following the death of the Ultimate Peter Parker.[5] He was featured in the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man comic book series, and after Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616), beginning with stories under the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding that debuted that same year, with Miles' original Earth-616 counterpart, the villainous Ultimatum, introduced in Spider-Men II in 2017.

            Reaction to the character varied. Some, including Spider-Man's co-creator, Stan Lee, approved the creation of a positive role model for children of color. Others expressed displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker, with The Guardian, Fox News, and Culture Map Houston reporting that some fans viewed the decision as an attempt by Marvel Comics to exhibit political correctness, and that the introduction of a minority Spider-Man was simply a publicity stunt to attract more readers,[6][7][8][9] a charge Alonso denied.[6] Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for the character to be judged on the quality of his stories, which garnered positive reviews.[10]
            
            As a result of the character's popularity, Miles Morales has been adapted in numerous media outside comics. The character was not the lead protagonist in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated television series, but was later added to the main cast, as an alternate Spider-Man from another universe voiced by Donald Glover[11] in season three and Ogie Banks in season four, now named Kid Arachnid.[12] Nadji Jeter first voiced the character in the Disney XD animated series Spider-Man (2017–20), and went on to reprise his role in the Marvel's Spider-Man video game series developed by Insomniac Games, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order (2019). The character is the protagonist of the animated Spider-Verse film franchise produced by Sony Pictures Animation, with Shameik Moore voicing the character in the Academy Award-winning feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), as well as its sequels Across the Spider-Verse (2023) and Beyond the Spider-Verse, in which Jharrel Jerome also voices Miles' Earth-42 counterpart, the villainous Prowler.[13]
